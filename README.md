> Works developed for the course of Special Topics in Statistics in the second semester of 2017 taught by professor [Josmar Mazucheli](http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?metodo=apresentar&id=K4799931Y7) at [DEs/UEM](http://www.des.uem.br/).


## Application of Association Rules and Classification Methods
In this work the techniques of association rules and classification methods were applied in two real problems.

1. Determine relationships between climatological variables and rainfall using data from climatological station at MaringÃ¡. The source of the data is Instituo Nacional de Meteorologia [(INMET)](http://www.inmet.gov.br/).

2. Prediction of Tennis Matches from the data available by [Francesco](https://github.com/okh1/tennis-prediction). The following classification methods were used: Classification Based on Associations, k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Naye Bayes.

## Permutation Test for Comparison of Multivarite Distributions

This work present a theoretical overview of permutation tests with focus on comparison of multivariate distributions.
Specially, I consider the Hotelling T2 test and the Nearest neighbor test.
